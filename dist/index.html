      <ul>
        <li>Born in 1785 and 1786, in Hanau, which is today's Germany.</li>
        <li>Started studying at Friedrichsgymnasium in Kassel in 1798 and thereafter went on to University of Marburg.</li>
        <li>Jacob found a job in 1808 as a librarian in Kassel and could thereafter provide for his impoverished family. Wilhelm later joined Jacob.</li>
        <li>This is also when the brothers started to collect folk stories.</li>
        <li>Between 1812 and 1830 they published a couple of books, including their first volume containing 86 folk tales, <em>Kinder- und Hausmärchen</em>. Other books contained works about Danish and Irish tales as well as Norse mythology.</li>
        <li>In 1830 they found work at the University of Göttingen, and tought German studies, but where they also continued to publish their books.</li>
        <li>In 1837, after a movement for democratic reform, Jacob had to resign his comission after refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the King of Hanover, and move back to Kassel. Wilhelm joined him not long after.</li>
        <li>Living close to poverty yet again, they decided to start writing a definitive dictionary of the German language, of which the first volume wasn't published until 1854.</li>
        <li>In 1840 they found work at the University of Berlin where they continued their work on the dictionary.</li>
        <li>Wilhelm died of an infection in 1859. Jacob continued the work on the dictionary until his own death in 1863.</li>
        <li>The last word in the dictionary was <em>Frucht</em> (fruit).</li>
